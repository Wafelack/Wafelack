Hey ! I'm a french student that loves [C](https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628) ,learning [RustLang] (https://rustlang.org)& loves having fun with computers. 

I've been programming since 2 years.

I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org) & Windows (Because of a compatibility problem, but normally i use [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) with KDE.)
